Studies relating to color knowledge in the Shipibo tribe in Amazonian Peru.

This code produces analyses associated with the paper "The Development of Color Terms in Shipibo-Konibo Children" by Martin Fortier, Danielle Kellier, María Fernández Flecha, & Michael C. Frank.

The primary writeup of our findings is contained in the reproducible manuscript file `paper/amazon_color.Rmd`. To reproduce the manuscript, clone the repository, download the associated packages using the `renv` package, and "knit" the document using RStudio and the `knitr` package.
